          p1: "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system. It is produced by specific neurons in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of the midbrain.",
          p2: "As a neurotransmitter, dopamine transmits information between neurons, affecting multiple functional areas of the brain, including:",

            "Attention and focus"
          ],
          p3: "Dopamine is best known for its role in the \"reward pathway,\" a system that makes us feel pleasure from food, social interaction, and other natural rewards, thus motivating us to repeat these beneficial behaviors."

          anticipation: {
            title: "Anticipated Rewards",
            content: "Dopamine is released not only when receiving a reward but, more importantly, when anticipating one. In fact, the expectation of a reward often produces a stronger dopamine response than receiving the reward itself. This is why the pursuit of goals is often more exciting than achieving them."
          },
          novelty: {
            title: "Novel Experiences",
            content: "Exposure to new, unexpected, or unusual stimuli triggers dopamine release. This mechanism encourages us to explore our environment, learn new skills, and try new things."

          achievement: {
            title: "Sense of Achievement",
            content: "When completing tasks, overcoming challenges, or achieving goals, the dopamine system rewards us. This feeling of \"achievement high\" motivates us to continue progressing and growing."

          pleasure: {
            title: "Pleasurable Activities",
            content: "Many naturally pleasurable experiences activate dopamine pathways, including good food, sex, social interaction, and certain forms of exercise. These activities trigger dopamine release for evolutionary reasons, as they promote survival and reproduction."

        addiction: {
          title: "Dopamine and Addiction",
          p1: "Various addictive substances (such as alcohol, nicotine, cocaine) and behaviors (gambling, social media) are addictive because they can directly or indirectly overstimulate the brain's dopamine system. These substances or behaviors can release more dopamine than natural rewards, activating reward pathways more quickly and intensely.",
          p2: "Over time, repeated exposure to these intense stimuli leads to adaptive changes in the dopamine system, including decreased receptor sensitivity and increased reward thresholds. This is why addicts need more and more stimulation to experience the same level of pleasure, while simultaneously having a diminished response to natural rewards."
